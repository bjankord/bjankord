# Hello

I'm Brett Jankord, a Software Engineer living in the midwest who enjoys working on front-end development, ReactJS, design systems, accessibility, responsive web design, CSS, SCSS, NodeJS, and open source software.

I also like to spend time riding my biking, grilling food, and playing video games.
